        <h2>Account Deletion Request Received</h2>
        <p>Dear {{ first_name }},</p>
        <p>We have received your request to delete your account. This process will take 3 months to complete.</p>
        <p>You will still have access to your account until then, but we highly recommend that you delete any saved documents, as they will not be recoverable after deletion.</p>
        <p>If you change your mind within this period, please contact us.</p>
        <p>Thank you,<br><strong>Realvista Team</strong></p>
